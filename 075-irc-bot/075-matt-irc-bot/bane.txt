[Plane outside in the middle of nowhere]
CIA: Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
Militia: He wasn't alone.
CIA: You don't get to bring friends.
Dr. Pavel: They're not my friends.
Militia: Don't worry, no charge for them.
CIA: And why would I want them?
Militia: They were trying to grab your prize. They work for the mercenary. The masked man.
CIA: Bane? Get them on board, I'll call it in
[INSIDE PLANE]
CIA: The flight plan I just filed with the agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you!
[PLANE DOOR OPENS]
CIA: First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!
CIA: Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel? [No answer, gun fires past head out open door] He didn't fly so good! [Pulls guy back in to plane] Who wants to try next? Tell me about Bane! Why does he wear the mask? A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!
BANE: [Still has black hood on] Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane.
CIA: At least you can talk. Who are you?
BANE: It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan.
[CIA SLOWLY TAKES OFF HOOD]
BANE: Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask.
CIA: If I pull that off would you die.
BANE: It would be extreamly painful
CIA: You're a big guy
BANE: For you
CIA: Was getting caught part of your plan?
BANE: Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. we had to find out what he told you.
Dr. Pavel: Nothing! I said nothing!
CIA: Well congratulations! You got yourself caught!
CIA Operative: Sir!
CIA: Now whats the next step of your master plan?
BANE: Crashing this plane  with no survivors!

BANE: No! They expect one of us in the wreckage brother!

BANE: Yes, the fire rises!
