  lifting is your hobby     so you like to lift things up and put it back down again 
Nah when I lift things they stay up Like cock pushups you only need one
     ew weirdo don't talk to me anymore
      Sauce
      Fox News
I don't tell girls I lift it's already obvious You see fellas I have other hobbies aside from liftingdeeper hobbies like philosophy and poetry which really impress the fairer sex
     Bitch have you ever lifted something up then put it back down It's pretty fucking great
       deeper hobbies like philosophy and poetry which really impress the fairer sex     not studying philosophy and literature as an ends in itself instead of as a means to impress girls   pleb
     Fitness is just a lifestyle choice not a hobby It's like saying being vegan or smoking bot is a hobby Maybe if you compete in powerlifting or bodybuilding otherwise it's just an activity like eating or smoking a cigarette Get into music learn to draw read more find a real hobby Fitness should improve your life not overshadow it
     Please tell me more about how quirky you are watching Parks and Recreations all day on Netflix
      Don't play games with me boy
  no I run a few times a week and some ab work     my actual hobbies consist of shitposting on a Bhutan incense forum and waiting for the next JonTron video and daydreaming about my projects since there is no escape from science research      mfw 
     Yeah lifting things is my hobby Then I'd lift her up princess style or with one arm just to show off Cause if she's comfortable enough to ask this question then she's more then likely going to be comfortable with a bit of seemingly nonsexual contact
      Unless you're hobby is running a free clinic or clothing the needy I don't see what hobby is supposed to be deep or meaningful
      cunts 
       Unless you're hobby is    you're hobby is    you're    you are    Unless you are hobby is   You should pick up a fucking book for a hobby racist shit
      my jimmies are so rustled
If you think that's bad try asking a woman what her hobbies are  She'll probably just bertstare for a second before she says Um well I like going out with friends and I love netflix   Or she'll say she rides horses in which case run as fast as you can as far as you can
     Damn you grammer nazis
       grammer nazis   Its Nazi's
  social media is your hobby    so you like to look at pictures of other people doing their hobbies 
      No You can say the same thing about the average guy Get to know some different women anon
     It'sit's
       a real hobby    real    hobby  do you not even realize how retarded you sound
     It's it's
     That stuff doesn't impress girls I say that having an interest in both
       le there is no such thing as an essentially real hobby    le liberalism relativistic nonsense   I bet you think there is no such thing as a 'real man' either You probably think faggots vegetarians and liberals are 'real men' when clearly they aren't men at all
       soccer is your hobby    so you like chasing a ball kicking it and chasing it again 
               Fuck off you smelly redditors
       le there is no such thing as an essentially real hobby  no there fucking isn't what the fuck how pretentious are you  a hobby is literally any pastime productivity isn't mentioned in any part of the definition of that word  enjoy lifting weights or playing video games those are both hobbies    real man  kek great analogy you utter nigger
     It's a team sport at least So chase it with your mates
       MMA is your hobby    So you like hugging a man to submssion 
       implying I'd ever tell anyone that I lift as a hobby   that's like telling them that I masturbate to cartoons on a more than daily basis  the idea is that you do these things privately so you can reap the benefits without exposing yourself to additional critcism
       That's really hot anon 
     That made it hilarious
       being so afraid of criticism you have to lie about yourself  pathetic
       Basketball is your hobby    So you're a double nigger 
       Look guys his face is turning red LOL 
       damage control 
      Alright Bye
      Yeah preferably heavy things But not too heavy I wouldn't pick you up for instance
Well I did become a much better cook because of lifting and looking after my diet Everyone says chicks like guys who can cook though I wouldn't know because I've spent dinner by myself for the past year and a half
        tfw still no gf even though I'm ripped as fuark   Why was I lied to fit Why
       I write muh poemz  teh slots 
     You are a faggot  Poetry is for fucking gays  Do you even lift
     This  He's not a REAL man REAL men don't read poetry they fight and fart and spit
     No lifting is not my main hobby because I'm not an autist with no real skills  I lift for health and fitness that is all I eat my macros I go to the gym for  minutes and that is it My main hobbies are painting and playing the piano as well as computer programming
               THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS  You fags who spend all their day thinking about lifting are more cringe worthy than those who spend all their time playing video games or watching anime Get some real hobbies and skills fags Become a renaissance man
       lifting is my main hobby 
       Become a renaissance man 
       I'm only good at one thing 
  tfw lifting is unironically your only hobby    except video games 
        minutes of gym   do you do like  light weight exercises do you even need to warm up
     Philosophy is for insufferable pseudointellectuals Poetry is for faggots
      saying you're into lifting    not saying you're into fitness or weightlifting   Lifting is a bro term Fitness is respectable Weightlifting is badass
     I stretch I do my lifts and then I get the fuck out  You don't need more time then that and if you do you're a fatass that does cardio
     Yes that is correct
       implying 
     How long have you been lifting and what are your max squat deadlift and bench press
     so you don't have any real skills  nothing else at all lifting is your main hobby that's sad
       not being fit STEM lit diy amp o 
     What a remarkably stupid thing to say
     basically this philosophy is fucking awful to talk about  but I've been gaining appreciation for poetry I still don't like it myself though
      years   squat  bench  deadlift  what's the issue here are you just going to say you lift more then me and therefore I'm wrong
  Actually shitposting on a Cantonese cartoon website is my hobby 
       I go around picking up girls literally  You're autistic and never been around girls
So much autism in this thread
       philosophy is fucking awful to talk about   For whom People who know nothing about it Sure Same as with everything else
       I visit the smart boards on an anime image board I'm a renaissance man 
       Lifting is your hobby    You have no other skills  Let me present this conversation in a different scenario So you like to read You just like to stare at words on a page Yes that is correct So you don't have any skills Nothing else At all etc Do you see how insane the things you are saying sound
     Real skills What do you mean And I enjoy working out Keeps me in shape  What do you like to do
     Hey everybody I laughed when I read this Thanks for listening
     well lifting is a thing you do to keep in shapenot really a hobby soumcan you paint play the guitar umm are you into literature maybe   you justlift
        I go around picking up girls literally  right time right place right amount of alcohol this could work  but so could a lot of things
     No I'm going to tell you that things are a lot easier those first couple years and you can make very good easy progress even with less than optimal programming
     umanonreading isn't a skill that's consuming media like playing video games do you maybeumm have a skill do you maybe play a sport uhcan you draw maybe ummplay an instrument or do you justgo into the gym and do the same thing everybody else doesbut with heavier objects
     Was it really remarkable or are you just peppering in extra adjectives for the fuck of it
     No babe I'm not some gym rat I like to stare at binded paper with squiggly marks on them then I begin a routine at a certain place where I stay seated in various rooms with other people and watch a person make noise with their mouth and squiggle on the wall Then I go to another place where I perform a set of tasks for green hemp paper This is my life
     bbut anon sempai my favorite youtube celebs tell me I don't need to spend that much time in the gym or I'll risk over training
     Here's how philosophy works Someone takes some universally true but fairly simple ideas and states them very eloquently Someone else misinterprets these statements and comes up with their own way to state these simple universal truths that while worded differently mean more or less the same thing They argue for a while then they die and people argue in their place all while feeling more enlightened for having done so Repeat ad infinitum
     Well it's remarkably stupid and reductivebut I guess you need that sort of fantasized figures because they help reinforce your pigeonhole based weltanschauung which provide convenient ad hominem attacks that you can use to silence opposing views with little to no effort
     playing a sport   or do you justgo onto a field and do the same thing everybody else doesbut with different set of people   drawing   or do you justget a piece of paper and do the same thing everybody else does but with different mediaobjectsviewability 
        Lifting is your hobby    Hhm Really    You don't look like you lift anon 
     You lied to yourself faggit
       presuming universal truths   lel read more
     Guys who are good at drawing get my pussy wet No girl ever Besides Macklemore says dudes who can draw are all gay
     ddont get so defensive anon  ok lifting is a skill have fun dedicating your whole life to something that should just be a way of life and secondary to any real skills
     This is that thing what I said happens it's happening right now Now you and I argue until we are dead both clinging to our slightly different ideas of what the definition of the term universal truths is and then we die and people carry the torch for us
     So is a girl going to be attracted to a guy who lifts like he should and has no skills Or a guy who lifts and also has a bunch of other hobbies and skills
  tfw no average  caucasian gf to make fun of my plateaus and lifestyle choices 
     So the latter then
     What part of what I said made you think those thoughts
     the fact that you implied that lifting prohibits you from having any real skills or hobbies
     We stand upon the shoulders of giants etc
     I'm quite sure I never said nor implied that
     yep you did
     I think you may be confused Anonymous is not a name not all of the posts in this thread were made by the same person
        you use lots of makeup     so you literally paint on a fake face cause your real one is ugly as fuck 
      yea u tell that bitch
       being this insecure    caring this much what people think about you   I'm a ' lb skelly and I still say I lift I'm not an autistic insecure beta faggot so unlike the scenarios you run in your mind women don't snicker and flee I just get an Oh cool I like to run and the conversation goes on from there

     Neeeeeeerrrrrrrrdd
     reading is just consuming media no better than watching tv  
       not reading self improvement books 
       thinking there's any insight in selfimprovement books   lel read this one Lost in the Cosmos The Last SelfHelp Book is a mock selfhelp book and social satire on the American value of autonomy by Walker Percy It was published in  by Farrar Straus amp Giroux  Organized into roughly four sections that explore ideas of the self Percy's thesis is that the social ills which plague society are a result of humanity's epic identity crisis Percy uses semiotic theories the theories of signs to argue that human consciousness of the self is unique from all other 'interactions' in the universe in that it is triadic It requires two sets of dyadic interactions between that of the sign user the sign and what the sign stands for in order to be complete As a result persons are thrust into the predicament of finding a sign that 'places' themselves  The book contains numerous essays quizzes and thought experiments designed to satirize conventional selfhelp texts while provoking readers to undertake a thoughtful contemplation of their existential situations and the search for meaning and purpose that could derive from such reflections
     them  Learn to grammar you stupid bitch
     so uhhhh who is this cutie patootie
     horse riding girls are fucked bro they're all crazy vapid and boring
     sounds too reddit for me
     lifting boys are fucked gurl they're all obsessive narcissistic and boring    muh protein    muh mussles    muh gains    muh lifting stats    muh need to work out all the time    muh constant checking selfreflection    muh constant need for validation   they literally talk about nothing else
     reading selfhelp books is reddittier
     So if reading novels is just consuming media and self help books are reddittier what do you read
     yea you're fucked when your hobby is chemical entrepeneurship   they're always Lolz whats that like breaking bad   have to explain why building a fortune starts as soon as you have a marketable skill but no these bitches just want a guy with money that doesn't work a guy that ripped but doesn't workout a genius without being a nerd like they don't know that the world isn't even remotely free
     I wasn't the guy making that comment  But sure reading poetry novels and philosophy IS just consuming media It's still infinitely more intellectually challenging stimulating enlightening and worthwhile than say watching The King of Queens on rerun  Selfhelp books are plebtier garbage though Have some selfrespect  Right now I'm reading Fredric Jameson's 'Postmodernism or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'
       a guy on fit reads  is this real life or fantasy  Mind if I ask what you're fave books are
           having favorite books   Too difficult

      PLS BE NATURAL
     Playing an instrument or doing any sort of creative craft which actually makes things is incredibly rewarding and getting good takes just as much if not more effort and dedication as getting fit
     my Hobbies maybe you want to try one    reading   there are books for everyone perfect if you ahve to wait for something have no Access to other media get away from a Screen and still be able to enjoy media you get better in the language you read the books  start with thin books tho or you will get frustrated also reading Trains you in shutting out your Environment from one moment to another and Focus on something    beach Volleyball  you get outside its easy to get to a skill lvl where you can Play decently enough you meet alot of People including Girls ist easy to get to know People since you always pls v and there is always someone looking for a m    travel  you like noodles go to italy and go into a fine ass Restaurant and look how fine ass noodles taste for example also most People dont know how cheap you can visit places around the world once were in paris with my gf for  days at new years which only cost us  each including Hotel  flight    tv series  there is a series for everyone too ist a nice alternative Thing to do when you are bored or just want to chill    vidya  same as for tv series you can easily make some friends with which you can do stuff online when nobody else has time for you i fe Play LoL with some friend abroad everytime i am lonely or just want to have some fun cheers me up alot    Lifting  health confidence Looks learning to push through barriers which is a skill you can use in other Areas too    drugs  mild ones alcohol weed and only rarely for situations where you feel like you deserved a goodie once every few months when i passed some hard exams i love me some sweet blunt with a Buddy and enjoy some Musicmovie   would also like to hear Hobbie suggestions to add

     Reading vidya and tv aren't really hobbies That's just entertaining yourselfconsuming media  Sports are good Try to have a variety of them I play field hockey for a club play badminton socially with a club and mess around with my cousins and some mates playing basketball I lift as well but I do that on my own  Learning an instrument is probably the best type of hobby you can have You learn about music culture have to discipline yourself to practice since it's heavily skill based and even just being able to strum some guitar chords sounds pretty good and is rewarding
       Reading vidya and tv aren't really hobbies That's just entertaining yourselfconsuming media   This so much    Learning an instrument is probably the best type of hobby you can have You learn about music culture have to discipline yourself to practice since it's heavily skill based and even just being able to strum some guitar chords sounds pretty good and is rewarding   Also this so much

     Yeah cunt I lift to stay fit healthy and enjoy myself what do you get out of your shitty hobbies like bingewatching netflix What about watching vlogs or slags put on makeup What about watching other people live their lives over the internet Do you even have any useful skill What do you even do in your free time     falling for women's shitty banter when they attempt to attack your masculinity and ideas    caring about their sense of superiority when they are demonstrably inferior    caring about what she thinks regarding your lifting   Why though

     I disagree I think a hobby is something that requires a certain level of dedication beyond consuming media

Recently I started to like covering myself in stale feces and masturbating Almost every morning I walk around my neighborhood with a large black garbage bag and collect all the crap I see It takes a whole day to get two bags full of shit But it all pays off when I come home after a hard day go to the bathroom turn on the hot water andmmm pour all the crap into the bathtub And then I masturbate imagining that Im being devoured by all the feces All in all I think that poo has its own mind each pile of shit has its own family place feelings we shouldnt just flush them down the toilet we should take care of them talk to them pet them And you know what I had a wonderful dream while lying in the bathtub yesterday I dived into the sea and it turned into shit fish seaweed jellyfish everything turned into poo even the sky Allah himself
